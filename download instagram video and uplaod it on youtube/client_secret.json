how to get a client secret Youtube API key

Create a Google Cloud Project:

step 1:Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Click on the project drop-down and select or create a new project.
Enable YouTube Data API v3:

step 2:In the Google Cloud Console, go to the API Library.
Search for "YouTube Data API v3".
Click on "Enable" to enable the API for your project.
Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:

step 3:Go to the Credentials page.
Click on "Create Credentials" and choose "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs".
Select "Desktop app" as the application type and fill in the required fields.
Click "Create" and a client_id and client_secret will be generated.
Download the client_secret.json file:

After creating the credentials, you will see a "Download" button. Click it to download the JSON file.
Save this file as client_secret.json in your project directory.
Hereâ€™s an example of what the client_secret.json file might look like:

json:
{
  "installed": {
    "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "project_id": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "redirect_uris": ["http://localhost"]
  }
}
Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID and YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET with the values provided by Google.

Move the client_secret.json to the correct location:
Ensure that client_secret.json is in the same directory as your Python script, or adjust the path in the script to point to the correct location of the file.
Your client_secret.json file is now ready, and your script should be able to use it to authenticate with the YouTube Data API.
